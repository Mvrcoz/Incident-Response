# Incident Response Procedures
**Objective**: Explores incident response strategies, focusing on social engineering attacks and log analysis.

## Tools Used
- **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**: Created social-engineering attack vectors.
- **Meterpreter**: Used for system interaction after successful exploitation.
- **Netstat**: Command to view active sessions and detect potential threats.

## Key Concepts
- **Incident Response**: Methodology for handling security incidents and mitigating their impact.
- **Social Engineering**: Simulated phishing attacks to understand user vulnerability.

## Lab Overview
1. **Phishing Attack**: Crafted with SET to simulate a browser exploit.
2. **System Analysis**: Analyzed system activity logs to identify unauthorized access attempts.

## Learnings
- Gained insight into social engineering and response protocols.
- Enhanced skills in identifying and mitigating active threats.
